# BucketCrew - Landing Page Copy & Pricing

## Hero
**Headline**: Your business deserves a team. Not another chatbot.
**Sub**: Upload your files. Pick a goal. Get a polished deliverable in minutes — like hiring a consulting team, without the consulting fees.
**CTA**: Start Free →

## How It Works
**Section headline**: Three steps. Zero prompts.

1. **Drop files into your Business Bucket**
   Upload your PDFs, spreadsheets, docs — anything about your business. Tag them by department. Done.

2. **Pick a TeamMate**
   Choose from pre-built workflows: market research, growth planning, SOP documentation. Each one runs a team of AI specialists on your behalf.

3. **Get a real deliverable**
   Not a chat response. A structured, skimmable, action-ready document with executive summary, recommendations, and a TODO checklist you can actually use.

## TeamMate Showcase

### Research Sprint
**Tagline**: "Know your market in minutes, not months."
Your research team scans your business files, analyzes competitors, and maps customer segments — then hands you a briefing doc.

### 90-Day Growth Plan
**Tagline**: "A strategic plan. Not a to-do list."
Your strategy team builds a prioritized growth plan with channels, offers, experiments, and KPIs — calibrated to your business data.

### SOP Builder
**Tagline**: "Turn tribal knowledge into real processes."
Your operations team reads your docs and outputs clean, standardized procedures your team can actually follow.

## Social Proof Section
**Headline**: Built for business owners who'd rather run their business than wrestle with AI.

- "I got a 90-day plan that was better than what my last consultant gave me." — *Beta tester*
- "I uploaded my messy sales docs and got back an actual SOP. In 10 minutes." — *Beta tester*

- **Your data stays yours.** Files are encrypted, workspace-isolated, and deletable anytime.
